Name: Andito Pranandya
Nickname: Dito
Position: QA

My Style
- I like when everything is planned and I tend to stick to the plans as much as possible.
- Despite being mostly quiet, I tend to be quite straightforward when I speak, especially during meetings where I need to review the progress.
- I put a separator between my work and personal lives in the sense that no matter how big a personal problem I'm having with someone, I'd put that aside while working with him/her.

My Work Hours
- I normally arrive at the office between 9.00 am to 9.30 am because I have to leave as late as 7 pm due to having a duty to take care of two sick family members.
- I'd like to be informed one day in advance if I will have to stay late on a day.
- Not staying late doesn't mean I don't finish my planned tasks for the day.

What I Value
- Honesty, Openness, Respect, and Understanding between co-workers.
  In short, I categorize people into two, Cengli (fair) and Bo Cengli (not fair).

Whatâ€™s the best way to communicate with me?
- Approach me directly, text, chat, call, or whatever way you think is the best at the time.
  I wouldn't be angry even if you call me when I'm busy because you might not know if I'm busy or not.
  There is no time when I don't want to pick up my phone. There are only times when I can't.

How to Help Me
- Commit to what you have planned.
- Be rational when facing challenges together.

What people misunderstand about me
- People think I'm mad inside just because I rarely make any facial expression.
- I'd be so quiet when I'm listening to someone. People often think I'm just daydreaming while I'm putting 1000% effort in digesting another person's ideas.
- (not work-related) My name is Andito, an Italian word for a big hall or passage, not Anindito. Thank you.

My Interests and Hobbies
- Cars: The engine, design, performance, etc.
- Music: I produce beats and sing too.
- Social Issues and how they can be solved.
